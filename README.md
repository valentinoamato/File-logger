# File-logger. 

### A simple Python3 program to keep track of your files.

## How to use.

To use the program simply run main.py with python3 and use the CLI to perform the desired operations.

## How it works.

The program works by creating a json file that contains all the names of the files and folders in an specified path. The script can then use this file to check for any addition or deletion of a file or folder in the mentioned path. Note that the program only detects changes in the names of files and folders.
